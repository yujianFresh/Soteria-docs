# Welcome to Soteria

This site provides documentation for Clover, an Operating System parachain on the Polkadot network. Here, you'll find both high-level and technical information for developers, collators, end users, and other Clover network participants.

This site will grow and be refined over time as Clover is developed. We welcome you to join the Clover community and contribute to this site and to the project.

## What is Soteria

Soteria is a decentralised alternative to insurance. Weâ€™ve used blockchain technology to create a mutual (a risk sharing pool) to return the power of insurance to the people. The platform is built on the Binance public chain (BSC). It allows anyone to become a member and buy cover. It replaces the idea of a traditional insurance company, because it is wholly owned by the members. 

### Things that our members can do:

* Buy smart Contract cover.
* Contribute funds to the mutual and hold SOTE tokens.
* Stake on smart contracts to show they think that contract is secure and to earn rewards.
* Put forward governance proposals
* Vote on proposals put forward by the team or other members.
* All members of the mutual are sharing risk with each other.
